## Slide 2: The NOC Operations Crisis

### Current State of NOC Operations
- **Reactive Operations**: Teams spend 80% of time on routine monitoring
- **Alert Fatigue**: Thousands of alerts daily, most are false positives
- **Manual Escalation**: Hours wasted on triage and handoffs
- **Limited Visibility**: Siloed tools and incomplete incident context
- **High Burnout**: 24/7 shifts with repetitive, stressful work

### The Cost of Inefficiency
- **$50K-$200K** annual cost per NOC analyst
- **$1M+** lost revenue per hour of critical system downtime
- **72%** of organizations experience alert fatigue
- **40%** of incidents take longer than necessary to resolve

```

### Learning Loop
1. **Observe**: Monitor systems and collect telemetry
2. **Analyze**: Apply AI models to detect patterns and anomalies
3. **Learn**: Update models based on outcomes and feedback
4. **Act**: Take autonomous actions or recommend human intervention
5. **Audit**: Record all actions and decisions for compliance
