# Production-ready-ish compose for AetherLink
# Runs the Phase II + Phase III services you finished:
# - Command Center (8010)
# - AI Orchestrator (8011)
# - Auto-Heal (8012)
# - UI (5173) – static-ish front layer
#
# Notes:
# - All services pull config from ../config/.env.prod
# - All have healthchecks + restart policies
# - Auto-Heal mounts docker.sock so it can restart containers
