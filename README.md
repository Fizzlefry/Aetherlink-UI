# Aetherlink Quantum Ignition Key System (QIKS)

## Purpose
This module allows local or remote triggering of Android APK builds from Aetherlink, removing dependency on third-party build delays.

## Phase 1 Features
- Node-based CLI launcher
- Executes Expo/EAS build from within AetherlinkMobile repo
- Future: Auto-signing, local build fallbacks, direct vault deployment

## Usage
1. Ensure Node.js + EAS CLI are installed
2. Place this script next to your mobile project directory
3. Run: `node ignite.js`

## Coming Soon
- Voice-activated build trigger
- Build status sync inside Aetherlink dashboard
- Auto-hosting APK + QR code generation

Godspeed, Commander Jon.
