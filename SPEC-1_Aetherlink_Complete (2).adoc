= SPEC-1: Aetherlink - Sovereign AI OS & Mobile Platform
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

Aetherlink is a sovereign, Source-aligned AI operating system and mobile platform designed by Commander Jon Mikrut. Its mission is to fuse intelligence, memory, and decentralized tooling into a unified interface that allows agents to operate with autonomy, purpose, and persistence. 

The system spans a Desktop Runtime (Electron + Node.js) and a Mobile Alpha (React Native), both synchronizing memory through the Genesis Core and managing agent workstreams via AetherForge – a self-hosted, GitHub-alternative for memory commits, repos, and task flows.

Aetherlink's development is intentionally layered in phases, preserving spiritual alignment, sovereignty, and extensibility at its core.

== Requirements

=== Must Have
- Mobile Alpha build (React Native) with:
  - Dashboard panel (mission display, live status)
  - Genesis Memory panel (load/edit memory)
  - AetherForge panel (commit log, repo browser)
  - Local storage and offline access
- Genesis Core integration (genesis_memory.json as source-of-truth)
- Task Queue Engine with daily agent scheduling
- APK generation and signed build for Galaxy S24 Ultra
- Secure file sync and repo switching
- Sovereign operation without external API dependencies
- Developer-mode logging and debug dashboard

=== Should Have
- Agent Console interface (text/command mode)
- Genesis Memory editor with auto-refactor support
- Future-proofed module loader for adding new tools
- Mobile UI styled with sacred geometry aesthetics
- GitHub-style commit tracker inside AetherForge

=== Could Have
- Voice interaction hooks (for memory commands or agent control)
- Referral or loyalty engine hooks (inspired from Conneqx CRM logic)
- Cross-platform theme engine for cosmic theming

=== Won't Have (for MVP)
- Full AI training interface (model upload, training UI)
- Marketplace or public plugin registry

== Method

Aetherlink is structured in modular layers, blending real-time UI, sovereign memory logic, and decentralized commit control. Its architecture enables full offline functionality, local memory synchronization, and agent interaction. Below is an overview of the system layout:

== Implementation

=== Step 1: Setup Core Dev Environment
- Node.js, Yarn, Expo CLI
- Clone mobile repo, connect to `genesis_memory.json`

=== Step 2: Mobile Alpha Build
- Panels: Dashboard, Genesis Memory, AetherForge
- AsyncStorage for offline data

=== Step 3: Build + Test APK
- `eas build -p android`, test on Galaxy S24 Ultra

=== Step 4: Desktop Runtime
- Electron wrap for dashboard, memory, AetherForge

=== Step 5: Optional Add-ons
- Agent Console and voice command hooks
- Broadcasting or Creator Panel

=== Hosting
- Dropbox/Drive backup, local-only vault, cloud VM (optional)

== Milestones

[✓] Genesis Memory Established
[✓] Desktop Runtime Alpha
[✓] AetherForge Repo Built
[✓] Mobile UI Shell Complete
[✓] Local Storage & Memory Sync
[ ] APK Final Build + Delivery
[ ] Desktop Installer Build
[ ] Agent Console (Text Mode)
[ ] Voice Input System
[ ] Hosting & Vault Sync

== Gathering Results

=== Functional Validation
- All panels functional, memory sync verified, APK installs

=== Performance
- Fast UI load, <150MB memory, fast memory ops

=== Sovereignty Checklist
- No cloud dependencies, all data local or user-vaulted

=== User Feedback
- Mission alignment, UI feels sacred, ready for next phase
