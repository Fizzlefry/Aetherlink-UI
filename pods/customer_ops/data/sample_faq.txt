Q: What underlayment do you use for roof installations?
A: We use synthetic underlayment with a minimum 30-pound rating, and in valleys and eaves, we install ice and water shield for extra protection. This combination provides superior moisture protection and exceeds most local building codes.

Q: How long does a typical roof replacement take?
A: Most residential roof replacements take 1-2 days for an average-sized home (under 3,000 sq ft). Larger or more complex roofs may take 3-5 days. We'll provide a specific timeline during your consultation.

Q: What kind of warranty do you offer on materials and labor?
A: We offer a 50-year manufacturer warranty on our premium shingles and a 10-year workmanship warranty on our installation. All warranties are fully transferable if you sell your home.

Q: Do you offer financing options for roof replacement?
A: Yes, we partner with several financial institutions to offer flexible financing options. We have plans starting at 0% APR for 12 months, and terms up to 120 months to fit any budget.

Q: What type of ice and water shield do you use in valleys and eaves?
A: We use Grace Ice & Water Shield®, a premium self-adhering underlayment that prevents water infiltration from ice dams and wind-driven rain. We install it 6 feet up from eaves and 3 feet on each side of valleys.

Q: What grade of plywood or OSB do you use for deck repair/replacement?
A: We use minimum 7/16" OSB or 1/2" CDX plywood for roof decking, depending on your roof structure and local code requirements. For areas needing extra strength, we'll use 5/8" decking material.

Q: How far in advance do I need to schedule a roof replacement?
A: During peak season (spring/summer), we typically schedule 2-3 weeks out. In the off-season, we can often accommodate projects within 1 week. Emergency repairs are handled within 24-48 hours.

Q: Do you handle all necessary permits and inspections?
A: Yes, we handle all permitting and scheduling of inspections as part of our service. Our team is familiar with local building codes and requirements, ensuring your project passes inspection the first time.

Q: How can I schedule an inspection or get a quote?
A: You can schedule an inspection by calling our office at (555) 123-4567 or using our online booking form at www.expertco.com/schedule. We typically respond within 1 business day.

Q: What makes your roofing company different from others?
A: We're a certified GAF Master Elite® contractor (top 2% of roofers), use only premium materials, and have a dedicated project manager for every job. Plus, we're fully insured, locally owned, and have maintained an A+ BBB rating for over 15 years.
